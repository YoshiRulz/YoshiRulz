Hi, you've found my profile page. I'm a software engineer, currently unemployed while studying at Macquarie University (Bachelor of IT maj. in infosec). As you can see from my activity chart, I keep myself busy by contributing to the BizHawk emulator project, as well as by jumping between the usual pile of unfinished side-projects. I don't really use GitHub for much else, I'm too reliant on some GitLab features that GitHub doesn't have.

Speaking of: [here's my GitLab profile](https://gitlab.com/YoshiRulz), and [here's my personal site](https://yoshirulz.dev) in case you want to find me elsewhere.

To keep up with my BizHawk escapades, even before they happen, follow [Yoshi's Hawk Thoughts](https://gitlab.com/YoshiRulz/yoshis-hawk-thoughts) (I had to set up an issue tracker to keep them in one place).
